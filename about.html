      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <h3>Running</h3>
      I enjoy <code>jogging</code> in my spare time. I started running as an attempt to lose weight in high school, but soon 
      the feeling of euphoria after a long run and my growing ability to control pace and rhythm gradually got me interested in this activity.
      Finished my <code>first half marathon</code> at
      <a class="nav-link nav-link-fade-up" href="https://www.charlottesvillemarathon.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">
        Charlottesville Marathon</a> in 2019. Now run about 4 miles per day to keep the habit of running.
      <br><br>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      Enjoy reading books of any categories, but especially like reading <code>detective novels</code>. Nevertheless, I seldom guessed the murderer right and  was never able to
      figure out the plot by myself though <span class='inline-block'>°(°ˊДˋ°) °</span>.
      <br><br>
      <code>Favorite detective novel author</code>: <a class="nav-link nav-link-fade-up" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edogawa_Ranpo">Edogawa Rampo</a>. Not only the plots of his novels are intriguing but also the
      motivations behind crimes are unique, having a sense of depraved beauty and charm of craziness.<br><br>

      <h3>Music</h3>
      For most of the time I listen to J-pop. <code>Favorite singer</code>: <a class="nav-link nav-link-fade-up" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimer'>Aimer</a>. Her voice is powerful and comforting. I remembered the feeling of lonliness but
      also the joy of inner peace when listening to <a class="nav-link nav-link-fade-up" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9GiOS9G5ts'>Polaris</a> by Aimer, walking along in the campus at night.

      <h2>Anime</h2>
      I am also a big fan of <code>anime</code>. Started watching anime since high school and fell in love with
      this world with boundless imagination and creativity immediately. It defines part of who I am now and is also the reason I get deeply interested in Japanese culture.
      <br><br>
      <code>Favorite anime for now</code>:
      <a class="nav-link nav-link-fade-up" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Champloo" rel="external"
        target="_blank">
        Samurai Champloo</a>, as its vision of life as an adventure, careless attitudes, artistic styles and
        soundtrack captivate me.
