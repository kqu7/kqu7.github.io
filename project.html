          <h5>Kaggle Cassava Leaf Disease Image Classification Task<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2021)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Individual Project</span>

          <p class="tab">Cassava Leaf Disease Classification is a multiclass image classification competition held at Kaggle 
            <a class="index-page-link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification">(https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)</a>. In this competition, 
            the training dataset includes 21,367 labelled images of Cassava leaves with four categories of diseases or a healthy category. The task is to classify 
            each image into one of the five categories above.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">
            In this project, I built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and ensembled a 3-model classifier trained on a dataset of 30,000 images (with 21,000 origianl images and 9,000 images from 
            another related competition). The competition dataset was unbalanced with 61.9% of training images labelled with CMD (Cassava Mosaic Disease). Dataset augmentation
            was done by by downsampling the majority class samples and upsampling the minority classes samples through various image scaling and color shifting.
            To combat the noise within the data, I applied CUTMIX, dataset augmentation, test-time inference, and various image transformations to make the classifier more robust.
            The ensembed model delivered 90.01% accuracy on the private dataset and was ranked 84/3947 (top 3%) in the leaderboard.

          <h5>Evaluating the Impact of Highway Network Desing on Population Dynamics<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2021)</small></h5>

          <br>
          <p class="tab">In this project, we aimed to detect the impacts of road and highway network development on the population dynamics of animal species under different 
            scenarios, using three models (single-species model, predator vs prey model, and multi-species interactions model).
          </p>
          <p class="tab">For each model, we defined the main behaviors of the population as growth and emigration based on the reaction diffusion system, 
             We assumed three kinds of initial population distributions (uniform, clustered, and even distributions). Over generations of populations, we tracked the density of population over areas and its growth/dispersal patterns, 
            analyzing the sensitivity of population of on the locations of highways. 
          </p>
          <p class="tab">In conclusion, we observed that the construction site of highway roads has a significant impact on the population, killing three many times population when it is constructed 
            in the center than when constructed on the peripheral sites. Also, by comparing the population change of different scenarios, we also discovered that the competitive relationship between species 
            can result in a lower death rate caused by highroads.

          <p class="tab">This is a course project for CS 7492 Simulation of Biology taken at Georgia Tech in Spring 2021. 
          I implemented four classical models (game of life, SIR, Gray-Scott diffusion) that are frequently used in biological observation and analysis, using the programming language Processing.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">For the game of life simulation, a cellular automata simulator was written. Users could control or create cell patterns by using mouse clicks and can also enter single-step 
            or continuous mode by using keystrokes. In the SIR model of disease transmission, a grid and agent based SIR epidemic simulator was implemented. Furthermore, a subpopulation graph that 
            tracked the change of different populations (infected, uninfected, recovered) was also made to analyze the trends over time.  In the reaction-diffusion project, I simulated a reaction-diffusion 
            system known as Gray-Scott and created patterns of spots, stripes or spiral waves by initializing the system with different parameter settings.

          <br>
          <p class="tab">We implemented four algorithms (branch and bound, approximation, and two variations of local search algorithms) attempting to cope with
            a well-known NP-hard problem in graph theory, the minimum vertex cover (MVC). We measured the performance of different algorithms in terms of running time and
            relative error, finding that one variation of the local searches performed best in terms of the above two criterias but the performance depended significantly
            on the starting point of the search.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">In addition, we analyzed the theoretical time and space complexities of the four algorithms, comparing the theoretical ones to the actual
            running time and providing explainations for some inconsistencies on certain graph instances.

          ranking system.
          </p>
          <p class="tab">Also, we proposed a method of rating products at term level based on users’ preferences.
          For example, if a user cares very much about the price of a product, we’ll offer another rating of the product
          solely based on the price factor. This method can be applied to recommendation systems to provide accurate recommendations.

          <br>
          <span class="tab">From the result analysis, we discovered that while the precision scores of some variations of LSTM models were high, it showed that all models
            had relatively low recall scores. We suspected that this was because of the inherent difficulty in sarcasm detection, and our models can only deal with the easy cases due to their limited structures

          <br>
          <span class="tab">Furthermore, we trained another identical ResNet50 Model (call it ResNet50_2). However, during the
          training of ResNet50_2, we freezed deeper layers to only train shallow layers to capture the overall styles of different

          <span class="tab">Our ResNet 50_2 model outperforms all other pretrained models by at least 1.5% in all the metrics we used.
