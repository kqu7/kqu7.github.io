          <h5>Kaggle Cassava Leaf Disease Image Classification Task<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2021)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Individual Project</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">We implemented four different algorithms (branch and bound, approximation, and two variations of local search algorithms) attempting to cope with
            a well-known NP-hard problem in graph theory, the minimum vertex cover (MVC). We measured the performance of different algorithms in terms of running time and
            relative error, finding that one variation of the implemented local searches performed best in terms of the above two criterias but the performance depended significantly
            on the starting point of the search.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">In addition, we analyzed the theoretical time and space complexities of the four algorithms, comparing the theoretical time complexities to the actual
            running time and providing reasons for some inconsistencies on certain graph instances.

          <h5>Optimal Review Ranking for Improving Shopper’s Decision Making<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2020)</small></h5>

          <br>
          <span class="tab">We developed a system that provides personalized ranking of  customer reviews for each shooper. Using
          cumulative position-weighted score, we were able to demonstrate that there is
          an average of 20% increase in user satisfaction using our personalized ranking system compared to the default Amazon
          ranking system.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Also, we proposed a method of rating products at term level based on users’ preferences.
          For example, if a user cares very much about the price of a product, we’ll offer another rating of the product
          solely based on the price factor. This method can be applied to recommendation systems to provide accurate recommendations.

          <!-- <h5>Sarcastic Tweets Detection<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Fall 2019)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Group members: Yuxin Wu (yw7vv), Issac Li (il5fq),
          Kai Qu (kq4ff) [All members were CS students at UVA.]</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">We experimented with different variations of CNN and LSTM models on the problem of sarcastic text detection
            with both the twitter and reddit datasets crawled from Kaggle, comparing the results of various models in different metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, and Accuracy)
          <br>
          <span class="tab">From the result analysis, we discovered that while the precision scores of some variations of LSTM models were high, it showed that all models
            had relatively low recall scores. We suspected that this was because of the inherent difficulty in sarcasm detection, and our models can only deal with the easy cases due to their limited structures

          <!-- <h5>DeepArt: Identify Artist from Painting<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Fall 2019)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Group members: Daniel Xiao (zx8yz), Kai Qu(kq4ff), and Haoran Zhu (hz3fr)
          [All members were CS students at UVA.]</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">We adapted and fine-tune different pretrained models (ResNet50, GoogLeNet, VGGNet11) to a dataset that
          contains artworks of 50 the most influential artists of all time and compare the results to our baseline model (ResNet18).
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Furthermore, we trained another identical ResNet50 Model (call it ResNet50_2). However, during the
          training of ResNet50_2, we freezed deeper layers to only train shallow layers to capture the overall styles of different
          paintings, comparing this result to the one merely by fine-tuning approach.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Our ResNet 50_2 model outperforms all other pretrained models by at least 1.5% in all the metrics we used.
          This validates our speculation that shallow layers play a more important role in understanding the overall style of
          paintings than deep layers.
