          <h5>Kaggle Cassava Leaf Disease Image Classification Task<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2021)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Individual Project</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Cassava Leaf Disease Classification is a multiclass classification competition held at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification).
             As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers. However, viral diseases are major sources of poor yields, 
             and to diagnose diseases, farmers require the help of agricultural experts to visually inspect the plants, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. The objective of this competition
              is to identify the common diseases with the help of data science and machine learning.
          </span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">In this competition, the train dataset includes 21,367 labelled images of Cassava leaves with four categories of diseases or healthy Cassava leaves. The task is to classify 
            each image into one of the five categories mentioned above.
          </span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">
            In this project, I built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and ensembled a 3-model classifier trained on a dataset of 30,000 images
            To combat the noise within the data, I applied CUTMIX, dataset augmentation, TTA, and various image transformations to reduce the noise within the data
            I trained Trained models that had 90% accuracy on the 5-fold validation and ranked 84/3947 (top 3%) in the private leader board

          <h5>Evaluating the Impact of Highway Network Desing on Population Dynamics<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2021)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Group members: Ge Zhang, Zhe Song, Kai Qu [All members were CSE students at Georgia Tech.]</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">In this project, we aim to detect the impacts of road and highway network development on population dynamics under different 
            scenarios using three models (single-species model, predator vs prey model, and multi-species interactions model) implemented in python
          </span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">For each model, we define the main behaviors of the population as growth and dispersal based on the reaction diffusion system, 
            in which the dispersal can be considered as the emigration process by animal populations. Initially, we have three kinds of population distributions 
            (uniform, clustered, and even distributions) to simulate the distributions of different species. Over generations of populations, we track the density of population and its growth, 
            analyzing the sensitivity of different species on the locations of highways. 
          </span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">In conclusion, we observed that the construction site of highway roads has a significant impact on the population, killing three many times population when it is constructed 
            in the center than when constructed on the peripheral sites. Also, by comparing the population change of different scenarios, we also discovered that the competitive relationship between species 
            can result in a lower death rate caused by highroads.

          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Individual Project</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">This is a course project for CS 7492 Simulation of Biology taken at Georgia Tech in Spring 2021. 
          I implemented four classical models (game of life, SIR, Gray-Scott diffusion) that are frequently used in biological observation and analysis, using the programming language Processing.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">For the game of life simulation, a cellular automata simulator is written. Users can control or create cell patterns by using mouse clicks and can also enter single-step 
            or continuous mode by using keystrokes. In the SIR model of disease transmission, a grid and agent based SIR epidemic simulator was implemented. Furthermore, a subpopulation graph that 
            tracked the change of different populations (infected, uninfected, recovered) was also made to analyze the trends over time.  In the reaction-diffusion project, I simulated a reaction-diffusion 
            system known as Gray-Scott and created patterns of spots, stripes or spiral waves by initializing the system with different parameter settings.

          <br>
          <span class="tab">We implemented four different algorithms (branch and bound, approximation, and two variations of local search algorithms) attempting to cope with
            a well-known NP-hard problem in graph theory, the minimum vertex cover (MVC). We measured the performance of different algorithms in terms of running time and
            relative error, finding that one variation of the implemented local searches performed best in terms of the above two criterias but the performance depended significantly
            on the starting point of the search.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">In addition, we analyzed the theoretical time and space complexities of the four algorithms, comparing the theoretical time complexities to the actual
            running time and providing reasons for some inconsistencies on certain graph instances.
